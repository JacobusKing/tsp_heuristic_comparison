# TSP Heuristic Comparison

This repository provides a framework for creating your own TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) heuristic as part of the Software CE.

## Repository Structure

There are four key `.py` files in the repo:

1. **`import_data.py`**  
   Contains functions for importing benchmark instances stored in the `instances` folder.

2. **`evaluate.py`**  
   Includes functions to evaluate tours (assuming 0-indexing) and plot them.

3. **`solver.py`**  
   This is where you will build your solver. Currently, it contains an example solver using the mathematical model of the TSP implemented in PuLP.

4. **`run.py`**  
   Demonstrates how to import and generate instances, pass them to your solver, and evaluate/compare the results to an optimal solution.

There are two folders in the repo:

- **`instances`**  
  Contains benchmark TSP instances along with optimal solutions for these instances.

- **`output`**  
  This folder will store graphs of the solutions generated by your solver.

## Instructions

1. **Branch Setup**  
   Cut your own Git branch from `main` and name it after yourself.

2. **Update `run.py`**  
   Write your name in the `name` variable at the start of `run.py` and import the solver that you will build.

3. **Build Your Solver**  
   Implement your own TSP solver (heuristic or exact) in the `solver.py` script. Your solver must:
   - Take the following inputs:
     - `distance matrix`  
     - `time limit` (in seconds)
   - The size of the distance matrix indicates the number of cities in the TSP instance.
   - Return a tour (0-indexed) as output, where the first city is numbered 0.

4. **Evaluation**  
   Ensure your solver outputs the correct tour with 0-indexing.

5. **Update `requirements.txt`**  
   Make sure to add any new dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
